[Legend]:
----------------

the first line is the read ID;
the 2nd line is the ground-truth DNA sequence of this read;

starting from the 3rd line is the actual data, which can be categorized into three 5 sections: sequence info, context-independent pore model, initialization position description, fragment description, and duration length. 

(a) sequence info:  
the 1st column shows 5-mer DNA sequence
the 2nd column shows the corresponding 5-mer ID (from 0 to 1023)

-----------------------

(b) context-independent pore model:
the 3rd column indicates the original stable pore model, that ALL the same 5-mer will be assigned the same value;
the 4th column indicates the Z-normalized context-independent pore model, that the same 5-mer in DIFFERENT reads will be assigned DIFFERENT value, but in the SAME read, the value will be the SAME.

-----------------------

(c) initialization position description:
the 5th column is mean value of the initialization position of this 5-mer fragment.
the 6th column is the standard variance value of the initialization position of this 5-mer fragment.
[note]: the initialization position is defined as the range that includes first 1/4 of THIS fragment and last 1/4 of PREVIOUS fragment.

-----------------------

(d) fragment description
the 7th column indicates the mean value of THIS fragment.
the 8th column indicates the standard variance value of THIS fragment.

-----------------------

(e) duration length
the 9th column shows the duration length of THIS fragment.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

[Note]:

The reason why we shall consider both the initialization point of a certain fragment is that this point has a STRONG correlation between the mean/std value of the previous and current fragment. If we neglect such information, we won't be able to simulate the raw signal well.
